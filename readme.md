## üìú Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end DevOps workflow for deploying a **Node.js (Express)** web application. The primary objective is to showcase proficiency in containerization with **Docker**, setting up a reverse proxy with **NGINX**, and deploying a scalable, highly-available architecture on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** using EC2 and an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

## Part 1: Docker Containerization üê≥

### Approach
The first step was to containerize the Node.js application using Docker. This approach ensures a consistent and portable environment by bundling the application code, Node.js runtime, and dependencies into a single, isolated container. The `Dockerfile` is optimized for security by creating a non-root user and for efficiency by leveraging Docker's layer caching for `npm install`.

### Deliverables

#### 1. Dockerfile
The following `Dockerfile` defines the steps to build the application image:

```
FROM node:20-alpine

# Create non-root user
RUN addgroup -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -G appgroup

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /opt/app

# Copy files
COPY . .

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Use non-root user
USER appuser

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8080

# Run app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

#### 2. Docker Hub Image
The resulting Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub and is publicly accessible here:
* **Image Link:** `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/eswarsaikumar/rablo/general`

#### 3. Instructions to Run Locally
To build and run this container on your local machine:

1.  **Build the image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/your-nodejs-app-name .
    ```
2.  **Run the container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 80:80 your-dockerhub-username/your-nodejs-app-name
    ```
3.  **Verify:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

## Part 2: NGINX as a Reverse Proxy üîÑ

### Approach
NGINX was configured as a reverse proxy to manage incoming traffic. This is a best practice for Node.js applications, as NGINX is highly efficient at handling concurrent connections and can also be used for tasks like SSL termination and serving static assets. `docker-compose` orchestrates the Node.js and NGINX containers for a seamless local development experience.

### Deliverables

#### 1. `nginx.conf`
This configuration file instructs NGINX to listen on port 80 and forward all traffic to the Node.js container on its internal port, 80.

```nginx
upstream webapp {
    server app:80;
}

server {
    # NGINX listens on the standard web port 80
    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://webapp;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

#### 2. `docker-compose.yml`
This file defines the multi-container setup, linking the NGINX proxy to the Node.js application.

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  app:
    # This will build the image from the Dockerfile in the current directory
    build: .
    # You can also use the image from Docker Hub if you prefer
    # image: your-dockerhub-username/your-nodejs-app-name

  nginx:
    image: nginx:1.21-alpine
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    depends_on:
      - app
```

#### 3. Instructions to Run
1.  **Start the services:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```
2.  **Verify:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost`.

## Part 3: AWS Deployment with Load Balancer ‚òÅÔ∏è

### Approach
For a scalable and resilient production environment, the application was deployed to two AWS EC2 instances. An **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** was placed in front of these instances to distribute incoming traffic evenly. The ALB also performs health checks, automatically routing traffic away from any unhealthy instance, thus ensuring high availability.

### Deliverables

#### 1. EC2 and ALB Configuration
* **EC2 Instances:** Two `t2.micro` instances were launched using RHEL-9 AMI. Docker was installed on each instance.
* **Security Groups:** Configured to allow HTTP traffic (port 80) from anywhere and SSH traffic (port 22) from a specific IP for security.
* **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** An internet-facing ALB was configured to listen on port 80.
* **Target Group:** The two EC2 instances were registered in a target group. The ALB forwards requests to this group on port 80 and performs health checks on the `/` endpoint.

#### 3. Deployment and Testing
1.  SSH into each EC2 instance and install Docker.
2.  Run the application container on each instance, mapping the instance's port 80 to the container's port 8080:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 80:8080 your-dockerhub-username/your-nodejs-app-name
    ```
3.  To test, access the **DNS name** of the Application Load Balancer in a web browser.
